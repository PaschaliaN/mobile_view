		<h1>Safari in Tanzania</h1>
		<h2>Maasai Photos</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				In November 2020, I visited two national parks in Tanzania. On my way I passed by a Maasai village, and they gave me a tour and allowed me to take photographs of home and their tradition to welcome guests.
				</p>
				<p>Maasai are a semi-nomadic Nilotic ethnic group native to Tanzania and Kenya.Masaai maintain their traditional customs and live in harmony with nature. 
				They originally lived in Northern Parks in Tanzania (around the Serengeti National Park and The Ngorongoro Crater).
				The Maasai are proud to share their culture and their ways of living with the public. One way they earn an income is by giving tours of their villages to the locals and tourists.  
				</p>
	
				<p>They play a big part in keeping the national parks preserved through their conservative lifestyles.
					They also collaborate with the government and park guides to safeguard the parklands by reporting unusual activities and identifying injured animals.
					It was truly remarkable to see a community that has learned to live in nature without being a destructive force.</p>
